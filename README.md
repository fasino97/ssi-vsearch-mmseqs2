# ssi-vsearch-mmseqs2
This repository contains all of the files necessary to run accuracy, homogeneity, and completeness on two different datasets using SSI-VSEARCH and SSI-MMseqs2. 

All of the information regarding VSEARCH can be found here: https://github.com/torognes/vsearch.
USEARCH is used as well in our SSI-VSEARCH implementation. The download and further information can be found here: https://github.com/rcedgar/usearch12.
The download and inforamtion about MMSeqs2 can be found on this Github repository: https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2.

The datasets used to test these clustering algorithms were the Ribosmal Database Project (RDP) and the SILVA rRNA database project.
The RDP database can be found here: https://www.glbrc.org/data-and-tools/glbrc-data-sets/ribosomal-database-project.
The Silva database can be found here: https://www.arb-silva.de/.
